     <h1>Kobe Bryant was not my favorite basketball player of all time.</h1>
    <p>
    Kobe Bryant did not play on my favorite basketball team.
    I disliked Kobe Bryant growing up as a kid because I thought he was a selfish basketball player who took too many shots and never passed the ball. 
    As a kid, I always believed that the Los Angeles Lakers never would have won those championships without Shaquille O'neill.
    In 2020, Kobe and his beautiful daughter passed away from a tragic and horrific helicopter accident. 
    Soon after, vidoes started surfacing about his work ethic and mind set to approaching the game of basketball. 
    Videos that proved me wrong about him being a selfish basketball player and teammate. 
    My favorite basketball player of all time is Michael Jordan. 
    Some experts believe these two(Kobe) were the only two to approach the game in the same manner. 
    Videos have surfaced of both of them saying that only one other person in the world could beat them 1 on 1. 
    They gave a hint at one another without name. Michael Jordan does not inspire me on the daily basis. 
    I do no feel any deep emotions when I see highlights of his play or because he is named the greatest player of all time. 
    I did not choose Kobe Bryant because I feel hatred and anguish when I see videos and photos of Lebron James and Brittney Griner. 
    I chose Kobe Bryant, the Black Mamba, because I am left with a deep emotion of sadness and inspiration to live my life becasue Kobe Bryant was stripped of his at a young age. 
    He had so much to still give to the game and to his family.
