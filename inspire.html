      <h1><span>Kobe Bryant was not my favorite basketball player of all time.</span></h1>
    <p>
    Kobe Bryant did not play on my favorite basketball team.
    I was not a huge fan of his while I was a kid because he was a selfish basketball player who took too many shots and never passed the ball. 
    I always believed that the Los Angeles Lakers won those championships because of Shaquille O'neill.
    In 2020, Kobe and his beautiful daughter passed away from a tragic and horrifying helicopter accident. 
    Soon after, videos surfaced encompassing his work ethic and mind set to approaching the game of basketball. 
    The videso were proof that I was wrong about him being a selfish basketball player and teammate. 
    My favorite basketball player of all time is Michael Jordan. 
    Some experts believe these two(Michael and Kobe) were the only two that approached the game with the same intensity and competitiveness. 
    Ome particualr video expressed both of them saying only one other person in the world could beat them 1 on 1. 
    They hinted at one another without name. Michael Jordan does not inspire me on the daily basis. 
    I do no feel any deep emotions when I see highlights of his play or because he is named the G.O.A.T.(greatest player of all time). 
    I did not choose Kobe Bryant because I feel hatred and anguish when I see videos and photos of Lebron James and Brittney Griner. 
    I chose Kobe Bryant, the Black Mamba, because I am left with a deep emotion of sadness and inspiration to live my life because Kobe Bryant was stripped of his at a young age. 
    He had so much to still give to the game and to his family.
