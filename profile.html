      <p>I am a full-time student trying to earn my second bachelor's degree. My first was from the <strong>University of Texas at El Paso</strong> in Kinesiology. I also did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. 
       In 2016, I retired from the army to begin my college education and transition into a civilian lifestyle.</p>
